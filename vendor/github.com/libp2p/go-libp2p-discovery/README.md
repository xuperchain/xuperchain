> Interfaces for active peer discovery

This package contains interfaces and utilities for active peer discovery.
Peers providing a service use the interface to advertise their presence in some namespace.
Vice versa, peers seeking a service use the interface to discover peers that have previously advertised
as service providers.
The package also includes a baseline implementation for discovery through [Content Routing](https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p-routing).
