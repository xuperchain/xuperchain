[Merlin][merlin_cool] is a [STROBE][strobe]-based transcript
construction for zero-knowledge proofs. It automates the Fiat-Shamir
transform, so that by using Merlin, non-interactive protocols can be
implemented as if they were interactive.

For more details, see [dalek-cryptography/merlin][dalek_repo].
